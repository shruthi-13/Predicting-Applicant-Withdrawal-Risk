Predicting Applicant Withdrawal Risk – TFA Case (R)
This repository contains an R-based predictive modeling project focused on predicting applicant withdrawal risk in the TFA admissions process. The goal is to analyze factors influencing withdrawal and build machine learning models that support proactive admissions strategies.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to identify applicants who may withdraw early from the admissions pipeline. Predicting withdrawal risk enables better resource planning and improved engagement with candidates throughout the process.
This case forms part of a practical predictive analytics study using the TFA dataset.

Techniques & Methods
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Handling imbalanced dataset using Downsampling and Upsampling
Building and evaluating multiple classification models in R
Performance evaluation using confusion matrices, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
